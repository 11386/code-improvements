# code-improvements
collaborators can help improve badly written code

Assignment 1
randomWeightedSort
I've written a working function that randonly sorts a list based on a set weighting
IMO, the code is badly written and can be massively improved using a more elegant solution
The task is to rewrite the function in a much better way
